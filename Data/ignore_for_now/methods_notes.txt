guidelines:
- size of CULVERT > 1.2*natural active channel OR >= active channel in wetland or low gradient system
- gradient within 1% of natural gradient
- embedded >=20% below natural bed scour depth and <=40% overall diameter
- backfilled with the same size and size fraction sediment
- low flow: should mimic depth & velocity of main stream
- pass 100 year storm at <100% of height
- stable stream banks upstream and downstream
- revegetation
 
immobile rock or forcing features may stabilize bed
 
aggradation failures are often due to oversized channel & lack of banks
 
bioengineering is critical (structures help)
 
 
objectives:
- evaluate stability of CONSTRUCTED CHANNELS and BANKS 
- evaluate stability of BIOENGINEERED BANKS and RE-VEG
hypotheses:
- CR >= 1.2 to maintain stable channel
   -> there is an ideal range, and effect is larger if CR is less
- stability outside will be greater than inside
 
 
drivers to design:
- stream size (breakpoint 8' width)
- gradient (breakpoint 1.5%)
 
 
only consistent width measurement was over the top
 
 
MANY culverts are constructed with artificial banks
some culverts had formed banks, though not designed to
 
 
channel features & grade control: spanning/partially/subsurface
- recode NA as "none"?
- or recode as yes/no
 
 
Visual observations of sediment transport:  (all 5 reaches)
- stable/moderate/severe erosion
- stable/moderate/severe aggradation
 
 
flow types
 
 
(cross sections were problematic)
 
 
Bioengineering assessments:
- condition score 1-5
- breakdown score 1-5
